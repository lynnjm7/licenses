# License Templates
These are a set of Free and Open Source (FOSS) licenses. The templates are pretty straightforward,
but are designed to be used with the Licensify, a command line utility to generate a license file 
for a project.

# Template Variables
Not every template accepts a set of variables as per their parent organizations specifications.
However, we currently support up to three template variables:
  
  * `{{ organization }}` := the person/organization that holds the copyright of a license
  * `{{ date }}` := the date of the license (typically just a provided year)
  * `{{ project }}` := the name of the project

# License
This set of templates is under the MIT license. See LICENSE for more details. This may change in
the future.
