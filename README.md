# License Templates
These are a set of Free and Open Source (FOSS) licenses. The templates are pretty 
straightforward, but are designed to be used with the 
[Licensify](https://github.com/lynnjm7/licensify), a command line utility to 
generate a license file for a project.

# Template Variables
Not every template accepts a set of variables as per their parent organizations
specifications. However, we currently support up to three template variables:
  
  * `{{ organization }}` := the person/organization that holds the copyright of a license
  * `{{ year }}` := the year/date of the license (typically just a provided year)
  * `{{ project }}` := the name of the project

# File Headers
We currently do not support file headers for licenses in licensify. Because of 
this, we do not provide a set of headers. However, the tool is designed to 
expandable in both features and licenses so adding this feature and these 
license snippets should be pretty easy.

# License
This set of templates is under the MIT license. See LICENSE for more details. 
This may change in the future.
